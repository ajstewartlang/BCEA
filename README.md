## Overview

Perform Bayesian Cost-Effectiveness Analysis in R.
Given the results of a Bayesian model (possibly based on MCMC) in the form of simulations from the posterior distributions of suitable variables of costs and clinical benefits for two or more interventions, produces a health economic evaluation. Compares one of the interventions (the "reference") to the others ("comparators").

## Features

Main features of `BCEA` include:

* Summary statistics and tables
* Cost-effectiveness analysis plots, such as CE planes and CEAC
* EVPPI calculations and plots

This is the **development** version of BCEA (currently 2.4). It contains a major refactoring of the code to streamline the functions.

## Installation
The development version can be installed using this GitHub repository. On Windows machines, you need to install a few dependencies, including [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) first, e.g. by running

```R
pkgs <- c("MASS","Rtools","devtools")
repos <- c("https://cran.rstudio.com", "https://inla.r-inla-download.org/R/stable") 
install.packages(pkgs,repos=repos,dependencies = "Depends")
```
before installing the package using `devtools`:

```r
devtools::install_github("giabaio/BCEA",ref="dev")
```
Under Linux or MacOS, it is sufficient to install the package via `devtools`:

```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools:install_github("giabaio/BCEA",ref="dev")
```

## Further details
More details on `BCEA` are available in our book [_Bayesian Cost-Effectiveness Analysis with the R Package BCEA_](http://www.statistica.it/gianluca/book/bcea/) (published in the UseR! Springer series). Also, details about the package, including some references and links to a pdf presentation and some posts on my own blog) are given [here](http://www.statistica.it/gianluca/software/bcea/).
